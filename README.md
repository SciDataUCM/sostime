## What is SOSTIME 🆘

SOSTIME is a Python application that given a location predicts how much time would take to the regional emergency services to attend a real-time request using Machine Learning.

## Explore the data 📖

We keep every data exploration we have ever done developing SOSTIME in [this Jupyter Notebook](/data-exploration.ipynb). 

## Requirements ⚙️

Besides [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) we will be using the following packages:

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You can simply install each package using `pip` as follows:
```bash
pip install <package>
```

Or you can install all the packages needed with the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
